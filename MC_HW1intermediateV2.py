#New research question: To what extent did main stream news media pick up on the recent Spooky Action at a Distance result?
#How many sentences, among the sources that mediacloud pulls from, include the three main terms together (spooky, action, distance)?
#Time frame given is all time (currently less than 1 month) past the publication date in Nature (Oct 21st 2015).
