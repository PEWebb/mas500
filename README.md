# mas500
# This repo contains projects for the MAS500 class. 


# Submission notes and research questions
## First submission (HW1_Notebook_AE.ipynb) is an example of how to mine insights from the mediacloud api. For more documentation, look here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mediacloud. This research question answers whether Trump or Obama were mentioned more in mainstream media in August 2015.

## Second submission (HW1_intermediate.ipynb and MC_HW1intermediate.py, with relevant requirements.txt and sample key config file) is a second research question that answers how many times mainstream media referenced "Spooky Action at a Distance" after the publication of a recent Nature result on October 21st, 2015. 

# Running the software

## Run the requirements.txt first, to install the required packages for this project
## Obtain an account from mediacloud and save your API KEY in a file, modeled after the sample key config file 
## Once you have successfully installed Jupyter, you can choose to work with the ipynb notebooks, open and run these for yourself (assuming you have cloned the repo and have these locally). You can also simply run the .py script for the intermediate homework directly from terminal or command prompt.
